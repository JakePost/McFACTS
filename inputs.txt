#PART 1 Inputs for Initial Conditions & Disk
#I'm putting in test initial values just to get this going.
# TO DO: These should all go in an input file to be read in.
#number of BH in disk to start
# Note: this will be a dynamic number.
# BH will disappear due to merger & get replaced with the product of a merger of 2 BH
# New BH will be added by disk capture.
# TO DO: Sample from a random (isotropic, thermal) distribution of orbits
# with random initial (a,e,i)
#Number of BH in disk (n_bh)
50.
#Mode of initial BH mass distribution in M_sun (mode_mbh_init)
10.
#Maximum of initial BH mass distribution in M_sun (max_initial_bh_mass)
40.0
#Pareto(powerlaw) initial BH mass index (mbh_powerlaw_index)
2.
#Mean of Gaussian initial spin distribution (zero is good) (mu_spin_distribution)
0.
#Sigma of Gaussian initial spin distribution (small is good) (sigma_spin_distribution)
0.1
#Spin torque condition. 0.1=10% mass accretion to torque fully into alignment.
# 0.01=1% mass accretion (spin_torque_condition)
0.1
#minimum spin angle resolution (ie less than this value gets fixed to zero) e.g 0.02 rad=1deg (spin_minimum_resolution)
0.02
#fraction of Eddington ratio accretion (1 is perfectly reasonable fiducial!) (frac_Eddington_ratio)
1.0
#Mass of SMBH in units M_sun (mass_smbh)
1.e8
#Maximum initial eccentricity (upper bound to initial uniform distribution) (max_initial_eccentricity)
0.3

#trap radius (fiducial 700r_g is reasonable to start) (trap_radius)
700.
#timestep in years. 10kyr=1.e4 is reasonable fiducial. Gives enough time for
# significant migration steps in Sirko & Goodman disk model and opportunity for
# multiple (repeat) dynamical encounters at plausible disk orbits
#(timestep)
1.e4
#For timestep=1.e4, number_of_timesteps=100 gives us 1Myr total time which is fine to start.

# THESE ARE NOT INPUTS! THIS IS HOUSEKEEPING!!! 
# OR PHYSICS!!! Put elsewhere!!!
#What is the spin angle indicating alignment with AGN disk (should be 0rad) (aligned_spin_angle_radians)
0.0
#Spin angle indicating anti-alignment with AGN disk (should be pi rad=180deg) (antialigned_spin_angle_radians)
3.14
#Start time (in years) (initial_time)
0.
#Fractional rate of mass growth per year at the Eddington rate(2.3e-8/yr) (mass_growth_Edd_rate)
2.3e-8
#Lower bound to eccentricity from damping (say e=0.01) (lower_bound_ecc)
