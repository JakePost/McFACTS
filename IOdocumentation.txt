Input/output documentation

Default input file : model_choice.txt
The default input file is described here; if you create your own input file, 
you must use the same nomenclature and ORDER as the default file to set your variables, and can use 
# to denote comments on lines separate from your inputs.
Inputs are grouped astrophysically, with accretion disk variables first, nuclear
star cluster variables second, and assorted other choices (time resolution etc.) last.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mass_smbh : float
        supermassive black hole mass in units of solar masses
    disk_model_name : string
        prefix to filenames for input disk model
        McFACTS comes with the following example options for disk models:
        flat: constant surface density & aspect ratio (unphysical)
        sirko_goodman: from Sirko & Goodman 2003
        thompson_etal: from Thompson, Quataert & Murray 2005
        If user has a disk model, it must specify the disk surface density
           as a function of radius in a file called name_surface_density.txt
           where the surface density is in units of kg/m^2 and the radius is in
           units of gravitational radii (R_g=GM_SMBH/c^2).
           McFACTS assumes the innermost specified radius in the disk surface density
           input file is the inner edge of the disk, and the outermost specified 
           radius is the outer edge.
           User must also supply the disk aspect ratio as a function of radius
           in a file called name_aspect_ratio.txt
           Both files must have surface density & aspect ratio specified at the
               SAME set of radii.
           Here name = disk_model_name
    trap_radius : float
        If the disk has a migration trap, its radius must be specified here
            to prevent overshooting in coarse grained models. If there is no
            trap, set trap_radius = 0. (all BH will eventually accrete onto SMBH)
            see Bellovary et al. 2016 for locations of sirko_goodman or thompson_etal
                migration trap 


# SMBH mass in units of M_sun:

#
# Choices about the SMBH accretion disk:
# 
# If user has a disk model, it must specify the disk surface density
#   as a function of radius in a file called name_surface_density.txt
#   where the surface density is in units of kg/m^2 and the radius is in

#       sirko_goodman: from Sirko & Goodman 2003
#       thompson_etal: from Thompson, Quataert & Murray 2005
#
#   If the disk has a migration trap, its radius must be specified below
#       to prevent overshooting in coarse grained models. If there is no
#       trap, set trap_radius = 0. (all BH will eventually accrete onto SMBH)
#
# Specify prefix to filenames for input disk model
disk_model_name = 'sirko_goodman'
# trap radius in r_g
trap_radius = 700.
#
#
# Choices about Nuclear Star Cluster Population:
#
# Initial conditions assume a Pareto initial mass function (user specifies
#   peak mass and power law index), a Gaussian initial spin distribution, 
#   the spin torque condition to align with the AGN disk, & mass accretion 
#   rate of fully embedded stellar mass black holes in terms of the Eddington
#   ratio.
#
# number of BH in disk to start (int)
n_bh = 60
# Mode of initial BH mass distribution in M_sun (peak of Pareto fn) (float)
mode_mbh_init = 10.
# Pareto (powerlaw) initial BH mass index (float)
mbh_powerlaw_index = 2.
# Maximum initial BH mass in distribution in M_sun (float)
max_initial_bh_mass = 40.
# Mean of Gaussian initial spin distribution (zero is good) (float)
mu_spin_distribution = 0.
# Sigma of Gaussian initial spin distribution (small is good) (float)
sigma_spin_distribution = 0.1
# Spin torque condition: fraction of initial mass required to be accreted
#   before BH spin is torqued fully into alignment with the AGN disk. 
#   We don't know for sure but Bogdanovic et al. says between
#   0.01=1% and 0.1=10% is what is required. (float)
spin_torque_condition = 0.1
# Accretion rate of fully embedded stellar mass black hole in units of 
#   Eddington accretion rate. 1.0=embedded BH accreting at Eddington.
#   (1 is perfectly reasonable fiducial!) (float)
frac_Eddington_ratio = 1.0
#
# Choices about Nuclear Star Cluster initial orbits:
#
# Maximum initial eccentricity (upper bound to initial uniform distribution)
#   this is ecc around SMBH of single orbiter
#   want to eventually turn this into some physically motivated thing
#   for now assuming uniform distribution [0.0 .. max_initial_eccentricity] (float)
max_initial_eccentricity = 0.3
#
# Choices about timing:
#
# McFACTS evolves populations once per timestep according to chosen physics
#   Choose a timestep that allows some things to happen, but not everything
#   to happen in one timestep. Migration timescale across your disk is a
#   good fiducial: 10kyr=1.e4 is a reasonable choice in a Sirko & Goodman
#   disk with a lot of 10Msun BH. Timestep is in units of years. Disk 
#   lifetime is set by choosing your number of timesteps:
#   lifetime = timestep * number_of_timesteps
# 
# timestep in years (float)
timestep = 1.e4
# For timestep=1.e4, number_of_timesteps=100 gives us 1Myr disk lifetime (int)
number_of_timesteps = 20
