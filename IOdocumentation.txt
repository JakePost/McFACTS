Input/output documentation

Default input file : model_choice.txt
The default input file is described here; if you create your own input file, 
you must use the same nomenclature and ORDER as the default file to set your variables, and can use 
# to denote comments on lines separate from your inputs.
Inputs are grouped astrophysically, with accretion disk variables first, nuclear
star cluster variables second, and assorted other choices (time resolution etc.) last.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mass_smbh : float
        supermassive black hole mass in units of solar masses
        default : 1.e8
    disk_model_name : string
        prefix to filenames for input disk model
        McFACTS comes with the following example options for disk models:
        flat: constant surface density & aspect ratio (unphysical)
        sirko_goodman: from Sirko & Goodman 2003
        thompson_etal: from Thompson, Quataert & Murray 2005
        If user has a disk model, it must specify the disk surface density
           as a function of radius in a file called name_surface_density.txt
           where the surface density is in units of kg/m^2 and the radius is in
           units of gravitational radii (R_g=GM_SMBH/c^2).
           McFACTS assumes the innermost specified radius in the disk surface density
           input file is the inner edge of the disk, and the outermost specified 
           radius is the outer edge.
           User must also supply the disk aspect ratio as a function of radius
           in a file called name_aspect_ratio.txt
           Both files must have surface density & aspect ratio specified at the
               SAME set of radii.
           Here name = disk_model_name
           default : 'sirko_goodman'
    trap_radius : float
        If the disk has a migration trap, its radius must be specified here 
            in units of graviatational radii (R_g=GM_SMBH/c^2) of the SMBH
            to prevent overshooting in coarse grained models. If there is no
            trap, set trap_radius = 0. (all BH will eventually accrete onto SMBH)
            see Bellovary et al. 2016 for locations of sirko_goodman or thompson_etal
                migration trap 
            default: 700.0
    n_bh : int
        Number of black holes embedded in AGN disk at t=0 (start of simulation)
        default : 60
    mode_mbh_init : float
        Initial mass function of BH is assumed to be a Pareto function
        Mode of initial BH mass distribution in solar masses (peak of Pareto fn)
        default : 10.0
    mbh_powerlaw_index : float
        Initial Pareto (powerlaw) index for BH mass function
        default : 2.0
    max_initial_bh_mass : float
        Maximum mass of initial BH mass distribution 
        default : 40.0
    mu_spin_distribution : float
        Mean of Gaussian initial dimensionless spin magnitude distribution (zero is pure dynamics)
        default : 0.0
    sigma_spin_distribution : float
        standard deviation of initial dimensionless spin magnitude distribution (small is good)
        default : 0.1
    spin_torque_condition : float
        fraction of initial mass required to be accreted before BH spin is torqued 
        fully into alignment with the AGN disk. We don't know for sure but 
        Bogdanovic et al. says between 0.01=1% and 0.1=10% is what is required
        default : 0.1
    frac_Eddington_ratio : float
        Accretion rate of fully embedded stellar mass black hole in units of 
        Eddington accretion rate. 1.0=embedded BH accreting at Eddington.
        Super-Eddington accretion rates are permitted.
        default : 1.0
    max_initial_eccentricity : float
        this is the initial eccentricity of a single orbiter around SMBH
        want to eventually turn this into some physically motivated thing
        for now assuming uniform distribution [0.0 .. max_initial_eccentricity]
        default : 0.3
    timestep : float
        McFACTS evolves populations once per timestep according to chosen physics
        Choose a timestep that allows some things to happen, but not everything
        to happen in one timestep. Migration timescale across your disk is a
        good fiducial: 10kyr=1.e4 is a reasonable choice in a Sirko & Goodman
        disk with a lot of 10Msun BH. Timestep is in units of years.
        default : 1.e4
    number_of_timesteps : int
        Disk lifetime is set by choosing your number of timesteps:
        lifetime = timestep * number_of_timesteps
        choosing default settings gives 1Myr lifetime
        default : 100
    retro : int
        Switch to inhibit retrograde binaries. This allows the user to test the (q,X_eff) 
        anti-correlation, which requires suppressing retrograde binary_bh_array
        retro = 0 turns all retrograde BBH at formation into prograde BBH. 
        retro = 1 keeps retrograde BBH once they form. Eventually will turn this into
        something physically motivated rather than a brute force switch.
        default : 0
